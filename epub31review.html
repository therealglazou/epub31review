    <p>Long looooong ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2003/04/14/2880-untitled">deep
        review of the XHTML 2.0 spec</a> that was one of the elements that led
      to the resuming of the HTML activity at the W3C and the final dismissal of
      XHTML 2.0. <a href="http://www.walrus-books.com/livre-numerique-ce-que-nous-avons-rate-pourquoi-nous-lavons-rate-et-comment-nous-allons-changer-les-choses/">It's
        time</a> (fr-FR) to do the same thing for the EPUB specs and draw some
      conclusions.</p>
    <p>Daniel Glazman</p>
    <h2>OCF</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>EPUB publications are not "just a zip". They are zips with special
        constraints. I question the "<em><code>mimetype</code> file in first
          uncompressed position</em>" constraint since I think the vast majority
        of reading systems don't care (and can't care) because most of the
        people creating EPUB at least partially by hand don't know/care. The
        three last contraints (zip container fields) on the ZIP package
        described in section 4.2 of the spec are usually not implemented by
        Reading Systems.</li>
      <li>the <code>container </code>element of the <code>META-INF/container.xml</code>
        file has a <code>version</code> attribute that is always "<code>1.0</code>",
        whatever the EPUB version. That forces editors, filters and reading
        systems to dive into the default rendition to know the EPUB version and
        that's clearly one useless expensive step too much.</li>
      <li>having multiple renditions per publication reminds me of MIME <code>multipart/alternative</code>.
        When Borenstein and Freed added it to the draft of RFC 1341 some 25
        years ago, Mail User Agents developers (your truly counted) envisioned
        and experimented far more than alternatives between <code>text/html</code>
        and <code>text/plain</code> only. I am under the impression multiple
        renditions start from the same good will but fail to meet the goals for
        various reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>each additional rendition drastically increases the size of the
            publication...</li>
          <li>most authoring systems, filters and converters on the market don't
            deal very well with multiple renditions</li>
          <li>EPUB 2 defined the default rendition as the first rendition with a
            <code>application/oebps-package+xml</code>&nbsp; mimetype while the
            EPUB 3 family of specs defines it as the first rendition in the
            container</li>
          <li>while a MIME-compliant Mail User Agent will let you compose a
            message in <code>text/html</code> and output for you the <code>multipart/alternative</code>
            between that <code>text/html</code> and its <code>text/plain</code>
            serialization, each Publication rendition must be edited separately.</li>
          <li>in the case of multiple renditions, each rendition has its own
            metadata and it's then legitimate to think the publication needs its
            own metadata too. But the <code>META-INF/metadata.xml</code> file
            has always been quoted as "<em>This version of the OCF specification
              does not define metadata for use in the metadata.xml file.
              Container-level metadata may be defined in future versions of this
              specification and in IDPF-defined EPUB extension specifications.</em>"
            by all EPUB specifications. The <code>META-INF/metadata.xml</code>
            should be dropped.</li>
          <li>encryption, rights and signatures are per-publication resources
            while they should be per-rendition resources.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>the <code>full-path</code> attribute on <code>rootfile</code>
        elements is the only path in a publication that is relative to the
        publication's directory. All other URIs (for instance in <code>href</code>
        attributes) are relative to the current document instance. I think <code>full-path</code>
        should be deprecated in favor of <code>href</code> here, and finally
        superseded by <code>href</code> for the next major version of EPUB.</li>
      <li>we don't need the <code>mimetype</code> attribute on <code>rootfile</code>
        elements since the prose of EPUB 3.1 says the target of a rootfile must
        be a Package Document, i.e. an OPF file... If EPUB 2 OCF could directly
        target for instance a PDF file, it's not the case any more for OCF 3.</li>
      <li>absolute URIs (for instance <code>/files/xhtml/index.html</code> with
        a leading slash, cf. <code>path-absolute</code> construct in RFC 3986)
        are harmful to EPUB+Web convergence</li>
      <li>if multiple renditions are dropped, the <code>META-INF/container.xml</code>
        file becomes useless and it can be dropped.</li>
      <li>the prose for the <code>META-INF/manifest.xml</code> makes me wonder
        why this still exists: "does not mandate a format", "MUST NOT be used".
        Don't even mention it! Just say that extra unspecified files inside <code>META-INF</code>
        directory must be ignored (Cf. OCF section 3.5.1) , and possibly reserve
        the <code>metadata.xml</code> file name, period. Oh, and a ZIP is also
        a manifest of files...</li>
      <li>I am not an expert of encryption, signatures, XML-ENC Core or XML DSIG
        Core, so I won't discuss <code>encryption.xml</code> and <code>signatures.xml</code>
        files</li>
      <li>the <code>rights.xml</code> file still has no specified format.
        Strange. Cf. item 8 above.</li>
      <li>Resource obfuscation is so weak and useless it's hilarious. Drop it.
        It is also painful in EPUB+Web convergence.</li>
      <li>RNG schemas are not enough in the OCF spec. Section 3.5.2.1 about <code>container.xml</code>
        file for instance shouls have models and attribute lists for each
        element, similarly to the Packages spec.</li>
      <li>not sure I have ever seen <code>links</code> and <code>link</code>
        elements in a <code>container.xml</code> file... (Cf. <a href="https://github.com/idpf/epub-revision/issues/374">issue
          #374</a>). The way these links are processed is unspecified anyway.
        Why are these elements normatively specified since extra elements are
        allowed - and explicitely ignored by spec - in the container?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Packages</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>a Package consists of one rendition only.</li>
      <li>I have never understood the need for a manifest of resources inside
        the package, probably because my own publications don't use Media
        Overlays or media fallbacks.</li>
      <li>fallbacks are an inner mechanism also similar to multipart/alternative
        for renditions. I would drop it.</li>
      <li>I think the whole package should have properties identifying the
        required technologies for the rendition of the Package (e.g. script),
        and avoid these properties on a per-item basis that makes no real sense.
        The feature is either present in the UA for all content documents or for
        none.</li>
      <li>the <code>spine</code> element represent the default reading order of
        the package. Basically, it's a list. We have lists in html, don't we?
        Why do we need a painful and complex proprietary xml format here?</li>
      <li>the name of the <code>linear</code> attribute, that discriminates
        between primary and supplementary content, is extremely badly chosen. I
        always forget what really is <code>linear</code> because of that.</li>
      <li>Reading Systems are free, per spec, to completely ignore the <code>linear</code>
        attribute, making it pointless from an author's point of view.</li>
      <li>I have never seen the <code>collection</code> element used and I
        don't really understand why it contains <code>link</code> elements and
        not <code>itemref</code> elements</li>
      <li>metadata fun, as always with every EPUB spec. Implementing <code>refines</code>
        in 3.0 was a bit of a hell (despite warnings to the EPUB WG...), and
        it's gone from 3.1, replaced by new attributes. So no forwards
        compatbility, no backwards compatibility. Yet another parser and
        serializer for EPUB-compliant user agents.</li>
      <li>the old OPF <code>guide</code> element is now a html <code>landmarks</code>
        list, proving it's feasible to move OPF features to html</li>
      <li>the Navigation Document, an html document, is mandatory... So all the
        logics mentioned above could be there.</li>
      <li><em>Fixed Layout delenda est</em>. Let's use CSS Fragmentation to make
        sure there's no orphaned content in the document post-pagination, and if
        CSS Fragmentation is not enough, make extension contributions to the CSS
        WG.</li>
      <li>without 3.0 <code>refines</code>, there is absolutely nothing any
        more in 3.1 preventing Package's metadata to be expressed in html; in
        3.0, the <code>refines</code> attribute was a blocker, implying an
        extension of the model of the <code>meta</code> html element or another
        ugly IDREF mechanism in html.</li>
      <li>the <code>prefix</code> attribute on the package element is a good
        thing and should be preserved</li>
      <li>the <code>rendition-flow</code> property is weird, its values being <code>paginated</code>,
        <code>scrolled-continuous</code>, <code>scrolled-doc</code> and <code>auto</code>.
        Where is <code>paginated-doc</code>, the simplest paginated mode to
        implement?</li>
      <li>no more NCX, finally...</li>
      <li>the Navigation Document is already a html document with <code>nav</code>
        elements having a special <code>epub:type</code>/<code>role</code> (see
        <a href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub-revision/issues/941">issue #941</a>),
        that's easy to make it contain an equivalent to the spine or more.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Content Documents</h2>
    <h2>Media Overlays</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>SMIL support across rendering engines is in very bad shape and the
        SMIL polyfill does not totally help. Drop Media Overlays for the time
        being and let's focus on visual content.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <h2>Alternate Style Tags</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>terrible spec... Needed because of Reading Systems' limitations but
        still absolutely terrible spec...</li>
      <li>If we get rid of backwards compatibility, we can drop it. Submit
        extensions to Media Queries if needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><em>On the fly</em> conclusions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>backwards compatibility is an enormous burden on the EPUB ecosystem</li>
      <li>build a new generation of EPUB that is not backwards-compatible</li>
      <li>the <code>mimetype</code> file is useless</li>
      <li>file extension of the publication MUST be <code>epub</code></li>
      <li>one rendition only per publication and no more <code>links</code>/<code>link</code>
        elements</li>
      <li>in that case, we don't need the <code>container.xml</code> file any
        more</li>
      <li><code>metadata.xml</code> and <code>manifest.xml</code> files removed</li>
      <li>we may still need <code>encryption.xml,</code> <code>signatures.xml</code>
        and <code>rights.xml </code>inside a META-INF directory (or directly
        in the package's root after all) to please the industry.</li>
      <li><code>application/oebps-package+xml</code> mimetype still needed</li>
      <li>the EPUB spec evolution model is/was "we must deal with all cases in
        the world, we move very fast and we fix the mistakes afterwards". I
        respectfully suggest a drastic change for EPUB 4: "let's start from a
        low-level common ground only and expand slowly but cleanly"</li>
      <li>the OPF file is not needed any more. The root of the unique rendition
        in a package should be the html Navigation Document.</li>
      <li>the metadata of the package should be <code>title</code>, <code>meta</code>
        and <code>link</code> elements inside the <code>head</code> element of
        the Navigation Document</li>
      <li>the spine of the package can be a list of <code>link</code> elements
        inside the <code>head</code> element of the Navigation Document or even
        a new <code>nav</code> element inside the <code>body</code> of the
        Navigation Document</li>
      <li>intermediary summary: let's get rid of both <code>META-INF/container.xml</code>
        and the OPF file... Let's have the Navigation Document mandatorily named
        <code>index.xhtml</code> so a directory browsing of the uncompressed
        publication through http will render the Navigation Document.</li>
      <li>let's drop the Alternate Style Tags spec for now. Submission of new
        Media Queries to CSS WG if needed.</li>
      <li>let's drop Media Overlays spec for now.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>EPUB is a monster, made to address very diverse markets and ecosystems,
      too many markets and ecosystems. It's weak, complex, a bit messy,
      disconnected from the reality of the Web it's supposed to be built upon
      and <a href="http://www.walrus-books.com/livre-numerique-ce-que-nous-avons-rate-pourquoi-nous-lavons-rate-et-comment-nous-allons-changer-les-choses/">some
        claim</a> (link in fr-FR) it's too close to real books to be disruptive
      and innovative.</p>
    <p>I am then suggesting to severe backwards compatibility ties and restart
      almost from scratch, and entirely and purely from W3C Standards. Here's
      the proposed result:</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>1. E0 Publication</h2>
    <p>A E0 Publication is a ZIP container. Files in the ZIP must be stored as
      is (no compression) or use the Deflate algorithm. File and directory names
      must be encoded in UTF-8 and follow some restrictions (see EPUB 3.1
      filename restrictions).</p>
    <p>The file name of a E0 Publication MUST use the <code>e0</code> file
      extension.</p>
    <p>A E0 Publication MUST contain a Navigation Document. It MAY contain files
      encryption.xml, signatures.xml and rights.xml (see OCF 3.1 for more
      information). All these files must be placed directly inside the root of
      the E0 Publication.</p>
    <p>A E0 Publication can also contain Content Documents and their resources.</p>
    <p>Inside a E0 Publication, all internal references (links, anchors,
      references to replaced elements, etc) MUST be strictly relative. With
      respect to section 4.2 of RFC 3986, only <code>path-noscheme</code> and <code>path-empty</code>
      are allowed for IRIs' <code>relative-part</code>. External references are
      not restricted.</p>
    <h2>2. E0 Navigation Document</h2>
    <p>A E0 Navigation Document is a html document. Its file name MUST be <code>index.xhtml</code>
      if the document is a XML document and <code>index.html</code> if it it
      not a XML document. A E0 Publication cannot contain both <code>index.html</code>
      and <code>index.xhtml</code> files.</p>
    <p>A E0 Navigation Document contains at least one <code>header</code>
      element (for metadata) and <code>nav</code> html elements in its <code>body</code>.</p>
    <h3>2.1. E0 Metadata in the Navigation Document</h3>
    <p>E0 metadata are designed to be editable in any Wysiwyg html editor, and
      potentially rendered as regular html content by any Web browser.</p>
    <p>E0 metadata are expressed inside a mandatory <code>header</code> html
      element inside the Navigation Document. That element must carry the "<code>metadata</code>"
      ID and the <code>vocab</code> attribute with value "<code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</code>".
      All metadata inside that <code>header</code> element are then expressed
      using HTML5+RDFa Lite 1.1. E0 metadata reuse EPUB 3.1 metadata and
      corresponding unicity rules, expressed in a different way.</p>
    <p>Refinements of metadata are expressed through nesting of elements.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>&lt;header id="metadata"
        vocab="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
        prefix="opf: http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf"&gt;
  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Author:&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;span property="creator"&gt;glazou (&lt;span property="opf:file-as"&gt;Glazman, Daniel&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Title:&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd property="title"&gt;E0 Publications&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</pre>
    The mandatory <code>title</code> element of the Navigation Document,
    contained in its <code>head</code> element, should have the same text
    contents than the first title metadata inside that header element.<br>
    <h3>2.2. E0 Spine</h3>
    <p>The spine of a E0 Publication is expressed in its Navigation Document as
      a new <code>nav</code> element holding the "spine" ID. The spine <code>nav</code>
      element is mandatory.</p>
    <p>See <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-packages.html#sec-package-nav">EPUB
        3.1 Navigation Document</a>.</p>
    <h3>2.3. E0 Table of Contents</h3>
    <p>The Table of Contents of a E0 Publication is expressed in its Navigation
      Document as a nav element carrying the "toc" ID. The Table of Contents <code>nav</code>
      element is mandatory. </p>
    <p>See <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-packages.html#sec-package-nav">EPUB
        3.1 Navigation Document</a>.</p>
    <h3>2.4. E0 Landmarks</h3>
    <p>The Landmarks of a E0 Publication is expressed in its Navigation Document
      as a nav element carrying the "landmarks" ID. The Landmarks <code>nav</code>
      element is optional. </p>
    <p>See <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-packages.html#sec-package-nav">EPUB
        3.1 Navigation Document</a>.</p>
    <h3>2.5. Other <code>nav</code> elements</h3>
    <p>The Navigation Document may include one or more <code>nav</code>
      elements. These additional <code>nav</code> elements should have an <code>role</code>
      attribute to provide a machine-readable semantic, and must have a
      human-readable heading as their first child.</p>
    <p>IDs "metadata", "spine" , 'landmarks" and "toc" are reserved in the
      Navigation Document and must not be used by these extra <code>nav</code>
      elements.<br>
    </p>
