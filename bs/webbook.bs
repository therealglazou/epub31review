Abstract: WebBook is a new format for electronic books, based on Web Standards only, and meant to make such books readable inside a browser.
</pre>

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

<em>This section is informative.</em>

The world of electronic books (ebooks) is very fragmented, technically
speaking. The current electronic book formats, inheriting from
multiple sources, are not readable inside a browser without a
dedicated programmatic layer. Even if the ZIP package containing the
electronic book is unzipped, finding and rendering the individual
documents composing the book is not a task anyone can
perform. Furthermore, most of these existing formats rely a lot on
dedicated XML or even proprietary binary formats that raise many
technical issues.

The current document proposes the Level 1 of a new electronic book
format, called WebBook, designed to free the electronic book market
from its current industrial silo to make it become a real first-class
client of the Web.

## Requirements ## {#reqs}

<em>This section is informative.</em>

The following requirements are the basis for the technical choices in this specification:

    1. one URL is enough to retrieve a remote WebBook instance, there is no need to download every resource composing that instance

    2. the contents of a WebBook instance can be placed inside a Web site's directory and are directly readable by a Web browser using the URL for that directory

    3. the contents of a WebBook instance can be placed inside a local directory and are directly readable by a Web browser opening its <code>index.html</code> or  <code>index.xhtml</code> topmost file

    4. each individual resource in a WebBook instance, on a Web site or on a local disk, is directly readable by a Web browser

    5. any html document can be used as content document inside a WebBook instance, without restriction

    6. any stylesheet, replaced resource (images, audio, video, etc.) or additional resource useable by a html document (JavaScript, manifests, etc.) can be used inside the navigation document or the content documents of a WebBook instance, without restriction

    7. the navigation document and the content documents inside a WebBook instance can be created and edited by any html editor

    8. the metadata, table of contents contained in the navigation document of a WebBook instance can be created and edited by any html editor

    9. the WebBook specification is backwards-compatible

    10. the WebBook specification is forwards-compatible, at the potential cost of <em>graceful degradation</em> of some content

    11. WebBook instances can be recognized without having to detect their MIME type

    12. it's possible to deliver electronic books in a form that is compatible with both this specification and [[!EPUB301]]

# WebBook instances  # {#instances}

A WebBook instance is a [[ZIP]] container. All files in a WebBook
instance MUST be stored as is (no compression) or using the Deflate
algorithm. All file and directory names must be encoded in UTF-8
[[!UNICODE]].  All File Names within the same directory must be unique
following case normalization as described in section 3.13 of
[[!UNICODE]]. All File Names within the same directory should be
unique following NFC or NFD normalization [[!UAX15]].

The file name of a WebBook instance SHOULD use the <code>wbook</code>
file extension, unless [[#epub-compat|compatibility]] with
[[!EPUB301]] is added; in that case, the <code>epub</code> file
extension is recommended.  User Agents should always treat a zipped
package with file extension <code>wbook</code> or <code>epub</code> or
using the <a
href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-ocf.html#app-media-type">EPUB
Media Type</a> [[!EPUB-OCF301]] as a potential WebBook.

A WebBook instance MUST contain a [[#navigation-document|navigation document]].

A WebBook instance and each directory inside that WebBook instance can contain
any number of files and directories. All files inside a WebBook instance
SHOULD have a file extension to ensure all User Agents (including Web
browsers) can render the file if necessary even if no HTTP header is
present or if the User Agent cannot determine the type of the file
from its contents.

Inside a WebBook Level 1 instance, all internal references (links,
references to replaced elements, etc.) SHOULD be strictly relative. With
respect to section 4.2 of [[!RFC3986]], only
<code>path-noscheme</code> and <code>path-empty</code> are allowed for
IRIs' <code>relative-part</code>. References to resources external to
the WebBook instance are not restricted.

<div class='example'>
<p>An example of Moby Dick packaged as a WebBook can be found <a
href="http://glazman.org/e0/samples/">there.</a></p>
</div>

## The navigation document ## {#navigation-document}

The navigation document MUST be a [[!html]] document named
<code>index.html</code> if its serialization is HTML and
<code>index.xhtml</code> if its serialization is XML. The navigation
document MUST be placed inside the topmost directory inside the
containing WebBook instance.

The navigation document is a regular html document, intended to be
rendered by a Web browser, that contains the following information:

* metadata:
    * a [[#content-document-title|title]] (optional)
    * a [[#navigation-document-language|main language]] (optional)
    * a [[#navigation-document-direction|progression direction]] (optional)
    * a [[#navigation-document-identifier|unique identifier]] (optional)
    * [[#navigation-document-other-metadata|other metadata]] (optional)
- [[#navigation-document-navdata|navigation data]] (optional)
- other html elements (optional)

## The title ## {#content-document-title}

The title of a WebBook instance represents the title of the electronic
book and is the title a User Agent SHOULD present to users. The title
of a WebBook instance is contained in the html <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-title-element"><code>title</code></a>
element of the WebBook instance's [[#navigation-document|navigation
document]].

<div class='example'>
<pre>&lt;html lang="en">

    &lt;head>
      &lt;title>Moby-Dick&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    ....
  &lt/html>
</pre>
</div>
If the navigation document has no <code>title</code> element, the
title of the WebBook instance is the empty string.

User agents should use the navigation document's title when referring
to the containing WebBook in their user interface. When the contents
of a <code>title</code> element are used in this way, the <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-directionality">directionality</a>
of that <code>title</code> element should be used to set the
directionality of the WebBook's title in the user interface.

## The main language ## {#navigation-document-language}

If the <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-html-element">root
element</a> of the [[#navigation-document|navigation document]] of a
given WebBook specifies a <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#attr-lang">primary
language</a> for the navigation document, that language is also the
primary language of that WebBook.

## The progression direction ## {#navigation-document-direction}

If the <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-html-element">root
element</a> of the [[#navigation-document|navigation document]] of a
given WebBook specifies a <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-dir-attribute">direction</a>
for the navigation document, that direction is also the progression
direction of that WebBook.

If the root element of the navigation document has no drection but has
a primary language, the progression direction of the WebBook should be
inferred from the WebBook's main language.

## The identifier ## {#navigation-document-identifier}

A WebBook MAY contain a unique identifier (no other WebBook may have
the same identifier; multiple instances of the same WebBook can have
the same identifier), such as a UUID, DOI or ISBN.

That identifier should be contained in a html element itself contained
in the [[#navigation-document|navigation document]] and
expressed using [[RDFA-PRIMER]], for example through the
<code>property</code> and <code>vocab</code> attributes.

<div class='example'>
  <pre>&lt;span property="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier">

  urn:uuid:A1B0D67E-2E81-4DF5-9E67-A64CBE366809
&lt;/span></pre>
</div>

<div class='example'>
  <pre>&lt;span vocab="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" property="identifier">

  urn:uuid:A1B0D67E-2E81-4DF5-9E67-A64CBE366809
&lt;/span></pre>
</div>

It's also possible to use the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute"><code>content</code></a>
attribute on a html <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-meta-element"><code>meta</code></a>
element but that approach makes the property not easily editable in a
Wysiwyg editor and is therefore strongly discouraged in the context of
a WebBook.

## Other metadata ## {#navigation-document-other-metadata}

The [[#navigation-document|navigation document]] can contain any
number of extra metadata, expressed through [[RDFA-PRIMER]], for
example through the <code>property</code> and <code>vocab</code>
attributes.

It's also possible to use the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute"><code>content</code></a>
attribute on a html <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-meta-element"><code>meta</code></a>
element but that approach makes the property not easily editable in a
Wysiwyg editor and is therefore strongly discouraged in the context of
a WebBook.

<div class='example'>
<pre>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Moby-Dick&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    ...
      &lt;span property="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier">
        urn:isbn:9780316000000
      &lt;/span>
      ...
      &lt;span property="http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified">
        2012-01-13T01:13:00Z
      &lt;/span>
      ...
      &lt;span property="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator">
        Herman Melville
      &lt;/span>
      ....
      &lt;span property="http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor">
        Dave Cramer
      &lt;/span>
    ...
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
</div>

## Navigation data ## {#navigation-document-navdata}

A WebBook instance MAY contain no more than one collection of navigation data serving two purposes:

    1. it specifies the Reading Order of the resources composing the WebBook

    2. it specifies the Table of Contents of the WebBook

A User Agent SHOULD render a WebBook without navigation data as an empty WebBook.

If present, navigation data are a <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code></a>
html element carrying the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/#doc-toc"><code>doc-toc</code></a>
role [[!DPUB-ARIA-1.0]] role and contained in the <code>body</code>
element of the [[#navigation-document|navigation document]].

The collection of all hyperlinks (<code>a</code> elements) inside
navigation data, in document tree traversal order, specifies the
Reading Order of all the resources composing the WebBook.

The collection of all hyperlinks (<code>a</code> elements) inside
navigation data having no <a
href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-inclusive-ancestor">inclusive
ancestor</a> [[!DOM]] holding a html <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-hidden-attribute">hidden</a>
attribute, in document tree traversal order, specifies the Table of
Contents of the WebBook.

User Agents can use the Reading Order to render all its resources, for
example, in one single paginated flow. User Agents can use the Table
of Contents for example to provide the user with an ordered collection
of resources he/she can directly navigate to on demand.

<div class='example'>
<pre>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Moby-Dick&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;nav role="doc-toc">
      &lt;ul>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="html/cover.html" hidden>Cover&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="html/titlepage.html">Moby-Dick&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="html/epigraph.html" hidden>EXTRACTS (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>&lt;a href="html/chapter_001.html>Chapter 1. Loomings.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
        ...
      &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/nav>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
</div>

# Compatibility with EPUB 3.0.1 # {#epub-compat}

<em>This section is informative.</em>

It is easily possible to turn a valid [[!EPUB301]] package
into a WebBook, retaining full compatibility with [[!EPUB301]], using
the following instructions:

    1. modify the EPUB package so its <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav">Navigation Document</a> [[!EPUB-CONTENTDOCS301]] is now:
        1. named <code>index.xhtml</code>
        2. placed inside the topmost directory of the package
    2. update all links and references to extra resources inside the Navigation Document to reflect the new name and location of the file inside the package (if needed)
    3. add the <code>role</code> attribute with value <code>doc-toc</code> to the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-types-toc"><code>toc nav</code></a> element of the Navigation Document
    4. update the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-item-elem">reference to the Navigation Document in the manifest of the Package Document</a> [[!EPUB-PUBLICATIONS301]] of the package to reflect the new name and location of the file inside the package (if needed)
    5. update references to the Navigation Document inside other <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-contentdocs">Content Documents</a> [[!EPUB-CONTENTDOCS301]] of the package to reflect the new name and location of the file inside the package (if needed)

<div class='example'> <p>An example of Moby Dick packaged in conformance to both
this specification and EPUB 3.0.1 can be found <a
